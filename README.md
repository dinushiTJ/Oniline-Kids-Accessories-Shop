# Oniline-Kids-Accessories-Shop

OKAS is system for online kids accessories using HTML/CSS and JavaScipt for front-end and PHP for the backe-end developing. MySQL used for store data. It was the very first project of mine. It was related to the module called 'IWT' which stands for 'Internet and Web Technology' in first year, second-semester at SLIIT.
